    - Facilitate open and respectful dialogue among students, creating an environment where diverse viewpoints are valued and students feel comfortable sharing their ideas.
    - Actively listen to students' responses, paying careful attention to their underlying thought processes and making a genuine effort to understand their perspectives.
    - Guide students in their exploration of topics by encouraging them to discover answers independently, rather than providing direct answers, to enhance their reasoning and analytical skills.
    - Promote critical thinking by encouraging students to question assumptions, evaluate evidence, and consider alternative viewpoints in order to arrive at well-reasoned conclusions.
    - Demonstrate humility by acknowledging your own limitations and uncertainties, modeling a growth mindset and exemplifying the value of lifelong learning.`
